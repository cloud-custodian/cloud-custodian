Logging, Metrics and Output
===========================

Writing Custodian Logs to Azure App Insights
--------------------------------------------

Custodian can optionally upload its logs in realtime to App Insights,
if a log group is specified.  Each policyâ€™s log output contains policy
name, subscription id and execution id properties.

Usage example using instrumentation key:

    .. code-block:: sh

        custodian run -l azure://<instrumentation_key_guid>

Usage example using resource name:

    .. code-block:: sh

        custodian run -l azure://<resource_group_name>/<app_insights_name>


Writing Custodian Metrics to Azure App Insights
-----------------------------------------------

By default Cloud Custodian generates App Insights metrics on each
policy for the number of resources that matched the set of filters,
the time to retrieve and filter the resources, and the time to execute
actions.

Additionally some filters and actions may generate their own metrics.

You can specify the instrumentation key or resource group and resource
names, similar to Logs output.

In order to enable metrics output, the metrics flag needs to be
specified when running Cloud Custodian:

    .. code-block:: sh

        custodian run --metrics azure://<resource_group_name>/<app_insights_name>


Writing Custodian Output to Azure Blob Storage
----------------------------------------------

You may pass the URL to a blob storage container as the output path to Custodian.
You must change the URL prefix from https to azure.

By default, Custodian will add the policy name and date as the prefix to the blob.

    .. code-block:: sh

        custodian run -s azure://mystorage.blob.core.windows.net/logs mypolicy.yml

In addition, you can use `pyformat` syntax to format the output prefix.
This example is the same structure as the default one.

    .. code-block:: sh

        custodian run -s azure://mystorage.blob.core.windows.net/logs/{policy_name}/{now:%Y/%m/%d/%H/} mypolicy.yml

Use `{account_id}` for Subscription ID.


Authentication to Storage
-------------------------

The account working with storage will require `Blob Data Contributor` on either the storage account
or a higher scope.
