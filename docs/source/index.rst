Cloud Custodian Documentation
=============================

A stateless rules engine for policy definition and enforcement, with
metrics and detailed reporting for AWS. It consolidates many of the
enterprise and departmental specific cloud controls organizations have
into one tool. Organizations can use Custodian to manage their AWS
environments by ensuring compliance to security policies, tag
policies, garbage collection of unused resources, and cost management
via off-hours resource management, all from one tool. Custodian
policies are written in simple YAML configuration files that specify
given resource types and are constructed from a vocabulary of filters
and actions. Custodian was created to unify the dozens of tools and
scripts most organizations use for managing their AWS accounts into
one open source tool.
